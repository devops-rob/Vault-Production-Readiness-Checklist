questions:
#   - question: 'Cluster Size'
#     answer: 'The reccomended cluster size for consul is 5 nodes.  This cluster size allows for fault tolerance whilst performing maintenence on a a node.'
#   - question: 'Consul Gossip Encryption configured'
#     answer: 'Members of the Consul clusters use a gossip protocol to communicate with eachother and hold leadership elections. This network traffic should be encrypted to minimise security risks.  You can read more about consul encryption [here.](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/encryption.html).'
#   - question: 'ACLs enabled and configured'
#     answer: 'The path that Vault uses in Consul's key/value storage to store it's encrypted data should be protected using Consul's ACL system. You can read more about configuring Consul's ACL system [here.](https://www.consul.io/docs/acl/index.html).'
#   - question: 'Consul Backups scheduled'
#     answer: 'As Consul is being used as a data store that Vault uses, it should be considered a stateful service, and as such, should have a backup strategy.  Consul snapshot, in addition to disk backups should be implemented on a regular schedule. For more information about consul snapshot, click [here](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/snapshot.html).'
#   - question: 'Consul Clients installed on Vault Nodes'
#     answer: 'Vault should not talk directly to Consul backend as this introduces an increased attack vector.  Instead, Consul should be installed on the Vault servers and configured in client mode. The clients will facilitate the communication between Vault and Consul.'
#   - question: 'Consul UI enabled (Optional)'
#     answer: 'If using a 5 node consul cluster, you can choose to enable the UI; however, it is recommended that the UI is enabled on two nodes only.'
