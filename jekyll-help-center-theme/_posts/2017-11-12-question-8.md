questions:
  - question: 'Ensure TLS is configured on Vault Cluster'
    answer: 'Enable end-to-end encryption using TLS certificates.  Vault agents should also use TLS certificates.'
  - question: 'Ensure TLS is configured on Consul Cluster'
    answer: 'Enable end-to-end encryption on consul cluster and agent. More information can be found [here.](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/encryption.html).'
  - question: 'Enable and configure SELinux / App Armour'
    answer: 'Enable and config SELinux / app amour depending on your operating system to create sandboxed contexts to  reduce blast radius if even the system is compromised.'
  - question: 'Configure non-standard ports for Vault'
    answer: 'By default, Vault uses port 8200 and 8201. Change the port to a non-standard port to provide extra hardening.'
  - question: 'Configure non-standard ports for Consul'
    answer: 'By default, Vault uses port 8500 and 8501. Change the port to a non-standard port to provide extra hardening.'
  - question: 'Revoke root token'
    answer: 'Once initial set-up of Vault cluster has been completed, the root token should be revoked.'
  - question: 'Revoke Consul Management ACL token'
    answer: 'Once the initial set-up of the Consul ACL system has been completed, the management token should be revoked.'
  - question: 'Configure server firewalls to restrict access only to required ports'
    answer: 'Using firewalld or IP Tables, configure these firewalls to limit port access to the vault and consul servers.'
  - question: 'Disable SSH'
    answer: 'Interaction with Vault is done via the API, even when using the CLI.  As such, there is no reason to have to SSH on to a vault server (if itâ€™s a virtual machine) so SSH should be disabled to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to the server.'
