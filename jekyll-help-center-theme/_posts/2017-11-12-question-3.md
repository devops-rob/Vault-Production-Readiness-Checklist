questions:
  - question: 'TLS Encryption is configured on Load Balancer'
    answer: 'Vaultâ€™s communications should be encrypted end-to-end with TLS and this should not be terminated at the Load balancer layer. The load balancer should also use the same encryption to communicate with Vault.'
  - question: 'HTTP Redirects configured'
    answer: 'With TLS configured, all traffic going via HTTPS will be encrypted; however, we need to ensure that there are no connections to vault via HTTP. The Load balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.'
  - question: 'Health checks enabled and configured'
    answer: 'Load balancer health probes can be used to ensure that traffic is only routed to a healthy leader node. Configure routing rules according to [these response codes](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/system/health.html).'
