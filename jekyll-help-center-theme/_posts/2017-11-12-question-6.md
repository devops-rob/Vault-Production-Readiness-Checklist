questions:
  - question: 'Enable audit device on 2 files on different disks'
    answer: 'Vault logs all requests and responses to requests. If Vault is unable to log requests and responses to these requests, it will immediately seize operations. To provide redundancy, each vault node should have 2 file audit devices enabled on separate volumes on separate disks.'
  - question: 'Log rotation configured on log files'
    answer: 'Enable and configure log rotation on the audit files to ensure the disks do not fill up and cause a vault outage'
  - question: 'Configure at least one IDP as an auth method'
    answer: 'Where appropriate, configure an existing identity provider (or multiple if required) as an authentication method in Vault.'
  - question: 'Configure the required secrets engines'
    answer: 'Identify and enable the required secrets engines for your business and technical use cases.'
  - question: 'Ensure KV v2 is enabled'
    answer: 'Ensure that Version 2 of the KV secrets engine is used to enable secrets versioning.'
