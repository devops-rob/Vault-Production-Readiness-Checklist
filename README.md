### **Infrastructure Architecture**

|  |  |
| --------- | ------- |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Infrastructure Workloads spread accross Availability Zones</summary> <p> Nodes in Vault clusters (and Consul clusters if being used as a storage backend) should be spread accross two or more failure domains known as Availability zones. The loss of a single Availability zone should not result result in a loss of service. </p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Machine Images Created (Virtual Machines only)</summary> <p> If you are deploying your Vault nodes on virtual machines, It is reccomended to build re-usable VM images that can be used to create cluster nodes in an immutable way.  Tools like [Hashicorp Packer](https://packer.io/) are designed to help build repeatable machine images for most virtualised and cloud platform. Machine images should be versioned and should follow a release cycle as new images are produced.</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Replication Enabled (Enterprise only)</summary> <p> If you are using the Enterprise version of Vault, you can enable replication between two or more Vault clusters in different geographical regions for added protection is Disaster Recovery scenarios.  Replication can be configured in Disaster Recovery Mode or Performance Replication mode.  If you are planing on using Replication, you need to provision infrastructure in an alternative region, with nodes spread accross multiple Availability Zones. For more information about the Enterprise Replication feature, see [the official documentation.](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/replication/) </p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Firewall rules configured to control access to Vault</summary> <p> Vault will likely contain business critical secrets which makes it a prime target for malicious actors. Access to vault to should be restricted to your private networks and not be accessible on the internet.  The Use of Virtual Private Networks is a commonly used approach to allow access to Vault from unknown networks</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Compute Resouces satisfy the minimum requirements</summary> <p> Ensure Hardware servers and Virtual Machines have been appropriately resources in accordance with the [Deployment System Requirements](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-reference-architecture#deployment-system-requirements) </p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Secondary Disk</summary> <p>Ensure that vault servers have a secondary disk attached to them. This will help with Audit Device Fault tolerance</p> </details> |

### **Consul Storage Backend**

|  |  |
| --------- | ------- |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Storage Backend Architecture</summary> <p> </summary> <p>It is a recommended pattern to use [HashiCorp Consul's](https://www.consul.io/) Key/Value store as the storage backend. The reccomended cluster size for consul is 5 nodes.  This cluster size allows for fault tolerance whilst performing maintenence on a a node</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Consul Gossip Encryption configured</summary> <p> Members of the Consul clusters use a gossip protocol to communicate with eachother and hold leadership elections. This network traffic should be encrypted to minimise security risks.  You can read more about consul encryption [here.](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/encryption.html) </p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>ACLs</summary> <p>The path that Vault uses in Consul's key/value storage to store it's encrypted data should be protected using Consul's ACL system. Once configured, the Management ACL token should be revoked.  You can read more about configuring Consul's ACL system [here.](https://www.consul.io/docs/acl/index.html)  </p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Consul Backups scheduled</summary> <p>As Consul is being used as a data store that Vault uses, it should be considered a stateful service, and as such, should have a backup strategy.  Consul snapshot, in addition to disk backups should be implemented on a regular schedule. For more information about consul snapshot, click [here](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/snapshot.html)</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Consul Clients installed on Vault Nodes</summary> <p>Vault should not talk directly to Consul backend as this introduces an increased attack vector.  Instead, Consul should be installed on the Vault servers and configured in client mode. The clients will facilitate the communication between Vault and Consul.</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Consul UI enabled (Optional)</summary> <p>If using a 5 node consul cluster, you can choose to enable the UI; however, it is recommended that the UI is enabled on two nodes only.</p> </details> |

### **Load Balancing**

|  |  |
| --------- | ------- |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>TLS Encryption is configured on Load Balancer</summary> <p> </summary> <p> Vaultâ€™s communications should be encrypted end-to-end with TLS and this should not be terminated at the Load balancer layer. The load balancer should also use the same encryption to communicate with Vault</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>HTTP Redirects configured</summary> <p> </summary> <p> With TLS configured, all traffic going via HTTPS will be encrypted; however, we need to ensure that there are no connections to vault via HTTP. The Load balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Health checks enabled and configured</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Load balancer health probes can be used to ensure that traffic is only routed to a healthy leader node. Configure routing rules according to [these response codes](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/system/health.html) </p> </details> |

As such, there is no reason to have to SSH on to a vault server (if itâ€™s a virtual machine) so SSH should be disabled to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to the server.</p> </details> |


### **Operational Readiness**

|  |  |
| --------- | ------- |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Configure auto-unseal</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Add a seal stanza to the Vault config file to reduce operational burden on operators. For more information check the [auto-unseal documentation here](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal/#auto-unseal)</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>PGP encryption of unseal/recovery keys</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Use PGP or Keybase to add an extra layer of security to the distribution of unseal/recovery keys.

| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Document key holders and contact details</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Ensure unseal/recovery key holders are documented on a Wiki and this document is kept up-to-date</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Trusted Broker/Platform pattern</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Choose a platform or broker that your business trusts and use this for secure injection of initial secrets. Examples are using Azure as a trusted platform or using Jenkins as a trusted broker.  Each organisation will differ with regards to what they trust so this should be a business driven decision.</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>OS Patching strategy</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Document an implement an OS patching strategy, whether itâ€™s updating VM images and replacing VMs with up-to-date images or whether its a controlled direct access update by an operator.</p> </details> |


### **Observability**

|  |  |
| --------- | ------- |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Logs shipping to central logs data warehouse</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Logs should be streamed to a central data warehouse as log rotation on the servers should be enabled and logs will be lost locally. A platform like splunk  is ideal for this use case.  There are other viable options available.</p> </details> |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Logs data mining scripts written.</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Decide the value that the log data should provide and write some scripts to extract this value from the data.

| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Logs alerting configured</summary> <p> </summary> <p>Some events should generate some kind of alert, for example, a root token being generated should be flagged and alerted on. Ensure these events have alerts configured for them.</p> </details> |

### **Governance and compliance**

|  |  |
| --------- | ------- |
| &#9744;   | <details><summary>Threat Model Exercise </summary> <p> </summary> <p>Conduct a threat modelling exercise using a framework of your organisations choosing and ensure you have documented and mitigated against all identified threats.</p> </details> |
